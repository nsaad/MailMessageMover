- add icon to app
- when X clicked in window, quit app
- if hit enter, with nothing selected, set the focus to either the textfield or the view
- looks like about window is missing?
- double clicking folder throws an error in the background / should do the "Move message" function

Resolved itself (looks like it - Nov 25)
- Search for "sa", get a long list, then scroll down and click on the "SA" bit, but the scroll goes back up and you have to go down manually

Bug (is it really an issue?)
- Job Stuff considered top level account, wrong should be under Gmail
- If two folders have the same name (eg Gmail -> Job Stuff -> Red Hat and Red Hat [acct base inbox], then the tree is completely messed up)
