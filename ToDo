- sometimes last selected folder is selected correctly in the view, other times it isn't, just the text updated
    Have more elaborate TODO in MailMessageMoverDelegateApp.m explaining issue
- add icon to app
- when X clicked in window, quit app
- if hit enter, with nothing selected, set the focus to either the textfield or the view

Resolved itself (looks like it - Nov 25)
- Search for "sa", get a long list, then scroll down and click on the "SA" bit, but the scroll goes back up and you have to go down manually

Bug (is it really an issue?)
- Job Stuff considered top level account, wrong should be under Gmail
